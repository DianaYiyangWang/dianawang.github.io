	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease ({AD}) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease leading to the irreversible loss of brain neurons and cognitive abilities, and the vicious interplay between oxidative stress ({OS}) and tauopathy is believed to be one of the major players in {AD} development. Here, we demonstrated the capability of the small molecule N-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-[5-chloro-2-methoxy(phenylsulfonyl)anilino]acetamide ({LX}2343) to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction of {AD} model rats by inhibiting {OS}-induced neuronal apoptosis and tauopathy. Streptozotocin ({STZ}) was used to induce {OS} in neuronal cells in vitro and in {AD} model rats that were made by intracerebroventricular injection of {STZ} (3 mg/kg, bilaterally), and Morris water maze test was used to evaluate the cognitive dysfunction in {ICV}-{STZ} rats. Treatment with {LX}2343 (5–20 μmol/L) significantly attenuated {STZ}-induced apoptosis in {SH}-{SY}5Y cells and mouse primary cortical neurons by alleviating {OS} and inhibiting the {JNK}/p38 and pro-apoptotic pathways. {LX}2343 was able to restore the integrity of mitochondrial function and morphology, increase {ATP} biosynthesis, and reduce {ROS} accumulation in the neuronal cells. In addition, {LX}2343 was found to be a non-{ATP} competitive {GSK}-3β inhibitor with {IC}50 of 1.84±0.07 μmol/L, and it potently inhibited tau hyperphosphorylation in the neuronal cells. In {ICV}-{STZ} rats, administration of {LX}2343 (7, 21 mg·kg−1·d−1, ip, for 5 weeks) efficiently improved their cognitive deficits. {LX}2343 ameliorates the cognitive dysfunction in the {AD} model rats by suppressing {OS}-induced neuronal apoptosis and tauopathy, thus highlighting the potential of {LX}2343 for the treatment of {AD}.},

	abstract = {Conventional vision-based systems, such as cameras, have demonstrated their enormous versatility in sensing human activities and developing interactive environments. However, these systems have long been criticized for incurring privacy, power, and latency issues due to their underlying structure of pixel-wise analog signal acquisition, computation, and communication. In this research, we overcome these limitations by introducing in-sensor analog computation through the distribution of interconnected photodetectors in space, having a weighted responsivity, to create what we call a computational photodetector. Computational photodetectors can be used to extract mid-level vision features as a single continuous analog signal measured via a two-pin connection. We develop computational photodetectors using thin and flexible low-noise organic photodiode arrays coupled with a self-powered wireless system to demonstrate a set of designs that capture position, orientation, direction, speed, and identification information, in a range of applications from explicit interactions on everyday surfaces to implicit activity detection.},

	abstract = {Testing sensors on human subjects is fraught with challenges such as extensive setup times and inconsistent data collection. This study explores the use of phantom organs as a solution to streamline sensor testing and validation. By replicating essential organ functions, phantom organs can provide a consistent and repeatable testing environment, improving data accuracy and reliability. Our development of a phantom lung, capable of emulating human breathing patterns, exemplifies this approach. This phantom lung could facilitate the testing of {ENDS} monitoring sensors, allowing for the safe and controlled simulation of smoking combustible and electronic cigarettes. The use of phantom organs not only reduces reliance on human subjects in sensor development but also fosters innovation by allowing experimentation with novel sensing mechanisms. This research highlights the potential of phantom organs to revolutionize sensor testing practices, ultimately accelerating the advancement of sensing technologies in various fields.},

	abstract = {Ubiquitous computing requires robust and sustainable sensing techniques to detect users for explicit and implicit inputs. Existing solutions with cameras can be privacy-invasive. Battery-powered sensors require user maintenance, preventing practical ubiquitous sensor deployment. We present {OptoSense}, a general-purpose self-powered sensing system which senses ambient light at the surface level of everyday objects as a high-fidelity signal to infer user activities and interactions. To situate the novelty of {OptoSense} among prior work and highlight the generalizability of the approach, we propose a design framework of ambient light sensing surfaces, enabling implicit activity sensing and explicit interactions in a wide range of use cases with varying sensing dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D), fields of view (wide, narrow), and perspectives (egocentric, allocentric). {OptoSense} supports this framework through example applications ranging from object use and indoor traffic detection, to liquid sensing and multitouch input. Additionally, the system can achieve high detection accuracy while being self-powered by ambient light. On-going improvements that replace Optosense's silicon-based sensors with organic semiconductors ({OSCs}) enable devices that are ultra-thin, flexible, and cost effective to scale.},

Traditional methods of peer review analyses often rely on exploration and statistics of existing peer review data, which do not adequately address the multivariate nature of the process, account for the latent variables, and are further constrained by privacy concerns due to the sensitive nature of the data. We introduce {AgentReview}, the first large language model ({LLM}) based peer review simulation framework, which effectively disentangles the impacts of multiple latent factors and addresses the privacy issue. Our study reveals significant insights, including a notable 37.1\% variation in paper decisions due to reviewers' biases, supported by sociological theories such as the social influence theory, altruism fatigue, and authority bias. We believe that this study could offer valuable insights to improve the design of peer review mechanisms.},

Scientometrics, the quantitative and qualitative study of scientific literature, provides valuable insights into these processes. We introduce Scito2M, a longitudinal scientometric dataset with over two million academic publications, providing comprehensive contents information and citation graphs to support cross-disciplinary analyses. Using Scito2M, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices. For example, rapidly developing, application-driven fields like {LLMs} exhibit significantly shorter citation age (2.48 years) compared to traditional theoretical disciplines like oral history (9.71 years).},
